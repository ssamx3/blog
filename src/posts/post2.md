Hello! welcome to my blog :)  
I had a lot of fun making this, so heres a walkthrough of everything I used to make it  
  
For the framework, I used sveltekit and mdsvex. Sveltekit is a really nice framework because it basically feels to me like just fancier 
html, and I really enjoy working in html. Mdsvex is a markdown precursor for svelte, and I found this through a blog post about
creating blogs :P
  
The main look of the app is just meant to be very simple, with minimal
styling, as it is meant to put emphasis on just the content. However, I did 
enjoy adding fancy animations when you hover on things :)
  
This was also the first time i've forayed into tailwind, and I have to say 
I really enjoyed using it! It makes a lot of things so much simpler to do, and it makes hover animations lovely. I will
probably now end up rewriting my main landing page with it, as i like it so much :D
  
I do still need to fix some stylings, as i dont have stylings for every available
markdown element, but once i've fixed that, the blog should be done!
  
I have been thinking about toying around with adding a markdown editor to a seperate version that writes directly to the
apps storage and making myself my own custom little notes app, as it wouldn't require that much work to get running,
and I love the responsiveness and design of this app.
  
P.S, In case you haven't noticed already, you can click on one of the tags to 
search by tag! I enjoyed implementing this feature, as it taught me quite a bit 
about how to actually use typescript! (click on the :3 for a secret)
